    { q: 'What is residential cleaning services?', a: 'Residential cleaning services are professional cleaning visits designed for private homes, condos and apartments. They usually include dusting, vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, kitchen and bathroom cleaning, trash removal and light surface sanitization. Services are customized to your home and schedule.' },
    { q: 'What is the difference between routine cleaning and deep cleaning?', a: 'Routine cleaning focuses on regular upkeep—vacuuming, dusting, surface cleaning, wiping counters, and bathroom refreshes. Deep cleaning is more thorough and includes tasks like scrubbing grout, washing baseboards, cleaning inside appliances and cabinets, and removing built-up grime from hard-to-reach areas.' },
    { q: 'How often should I schedule residential cleaning?', a: 'There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Many customers choose weekly or biweekly service for busy households, monthly for light upkeep, or a one-time deep clean. We help you pick a cadence that fits your lifestyle and budget.' },
    { q: 'Do I need to provide cleaning supplies or equipment?', a: 'No — our teams arrive equipped with professional-grade vacuums, mops, cleaners and microfibers. If you have specific product preferences (eco-friendly, fragrance-free), let us know and we will accommodate when possible.' },
    { q: 'What happens if something is damaged during cleaning?', a: 'Although incidents are rare, JACCS Cleaning Services maintains liability coverage. Report any accidental damage and we will document and resolve the issue promptly. We train our teams to treat your home and belongings carefully.' }
